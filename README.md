## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to help a client figure if opening an ice cream shop in hawaii was a good investment. We conducted a weather analysis for the location in which our client wants to possibly open a shop. He wants to know the weather temp patterns and precipation, the ideal weather to keep a ice cream shop open would be warm with clear skies for the majorty of time. therefore we conducted a statistical on the data provided to find out what is the weather like for the last 7 years. this analysis was perfomrn for client to present to investors in whihc we use flask(a web browser platform) to present the data.

## Results: 
As we analyze the results for the June temperatures we can see the the data sample collected was 1700 observations. The temperature does not really fluctuate and looking the statistical analyses the standard deveation is small, therefore the temperature spread is not much. We can see in the image below:

Looking at the December temperatures we can say the same as for the June's numbers, the spread is small, temps dont fluctuate much they stay pretty steady. For December they also had a pretty large data set with 1517 observations from 2010 to 2017. We can see in the image below:

## Summary: 
In summary our client does have a good warm weather to put a ice cream shop in Hawaii, but the temp analysis is not a just one factor that can affect the success of the investment. We would need to conduct another query looking at precipation for those months. We dont want to invest in a shop where the location might have warm weather but its frequently rains. Another query that would be helpful is to look at the stations which are more active, this will help us narrow down the location with the most data stable information.
